# To know which GPS antenna you are using

external : **,3

internal : **,2
 ```
gpsctl -x '$PGCMD,33,1*6C' /dev/ttyS0
/dev/ttyS0 identified as a MTK-3301 AXN_2.31_3339_13101700-5632 at 9600 baud.
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gpspipe -r | grep PGTOP
$PGTOP,11,3*6F
$PGTOP,11,3*6F
$PGTOP,11,3*6F
 ```
We are using the external GPS antenna for better results.

# Setting the SHM offset

the SHM offset is a fixed time correction (in seconds) that tells Chrony to add or subtract from the GPSâ€™s time signal to make it accurate and to compensate for the delay of messages.
Initially in GPS_setup.sh, the offset is 0 but we have to change it for better results.

For that we use statistics, after an hour or more of running chronny, run this command
```
sudo cat /var/log/chrony/statistics.log > GPS_statistics/chrony_statistics.log #keep the last ~100 lines only
python 3 GPS_statistics/statistics.py
```
We get for example:
```
chrony Statistics Summary:
------------------------------
Number of IP Addresses: 22
Time Range: 2025-06-30 12:04:15 to 2025-07-02 14:11:37

Average Estimated Offset by IP:

NMEA: 4.23e-01

Median Estimated Offset by IP:

NMEA: 4.26e-01
```
So in our case, we take the value in the middle:
4.245 
we modify it in /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
```
sudo nano /etc/chrony/chrony.conf
"modify: refclock SHM 0 refid NMEA offset 4.245 precision 1e-3 poll 0 filter 3
sudo systemctl restart chrony
```
