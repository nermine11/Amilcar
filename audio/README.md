We use hifiberry DAC + ADC PRO to convert the analog signals from the hydrophone into digital signals since Raspberry Pi can't do that on its own.

You will need an updated Linux kernel. You will need at least version 4.18.12. You can check this using the command uname
```
# uname -a
```

After running audio_setup.sh, The system should now list the correct card:
```
# arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 0: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dacplusadc], 
 device 0: HiFiBerry DAC+ADC HiFi multicodec-0 []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```
If you have configured the correct overlay, but the system still doesnâ€™t load the driver, you need to disable the onboard EEPROM by 
running
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'force_eeprom_read=0' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
```
