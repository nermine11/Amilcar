We use hifiberry DAC + ADC PRO tp convert the analog signals from the hydrophone into digital signals since Raspberry Pi can't do that on its own.

You will need an updated Linux kernel. You will need at least version 4.18.12. You can check this using the command uname
```
# uname -a
```
Linux hifiberry 4.18.12-v7 #1 SMP ...

After running audio_setup.sh, The system should now list the correct card:
```
# arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 0: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dacplusadc], 
 device 0: HiFiBerry DAC+ADC HiFi multicodec-0 []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```
If you have configured the correct overlay, but the system still doesnâ€™t load the driver, you need to disable the onboard EEPROM by 
running
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'force_eeprom_read=0' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
```
**Setting the correct input amplifier settings for a microphone**
By default, the input sensitivity is matched for line-level audio sources like the audio output of your mobile phone, CD player or Amazon Alexa. This is doing via a jumper on the J1 header.

To use the hydrophone, the jumper needs to be set differently as shown in the following picture. Otherwise, the volume would be very low.
