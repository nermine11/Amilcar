We use hifiberry DAC + ADC PRO to convert the analog signals from the hydrophone into digital signals since Raspberry Pi can't do that on its own.

We use the Aquarium H2dM hydrophone:

You will need an updated Linux kernel. You will need at least version 4.18.12. You can check this using the command uname
```
# uname -a
```

After running audio_setup.sh, The system should now list the correct card:
```
# arecord -l
**** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
card 0: sndrpihifiberry [snd_rpi_hifiberry_dacplusadc], 
 device 0: HiFiBerry DAC+ADC HiFi multicodec-0 []
  Subdevices: 1/1
  Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
```
If you have configured the correct overlay, but the system still doesnâ€™t load the driver, you need to disable the onboard EEPROM by 
running
```
sudo bash -c "echo 'force_eeprom_read=0' >> /boot/firmware/config.txt"
```
**Choice of sampling rate and bit depth** 

What we are testing here is the choice of the sampling rate (44.1Khz or 48Khz) and the bit depth(16bit or 24bit)

 Try the following command to record for 3 seconds, bit depth 16, wav format, and show VU meter.
```
arecord -D sysdefault -r 44100 -d 3 -f S16 -t wav -V mono test.wav
```
then test using sampling rate 480000, bit depth 24
```
arecord -D sysdefault -r 48000 -d 3 -f S24 -t wav -V mono test.wav
```

You will notice that the hydrophone signal is very low. This is expected and we need to boost the signal with the following command:

```
amixer -D sysdefault cset name='ADC Capture Volume' 96,96
```
"The values of this command are steps between 0 and 104 and will set ADC volume 0.5db/step. So 96 is about 48dB. You may adjust this value to a lower level depending on the sensitivity. A 33dB gain should work just fine. You may retry to record again and observe the VU meter levels."

- If the VU meter levels are too low (1-10%)  increase the gain
- If the VU meter levels are too high(near 10%) reduce the gain

When you find the right value, to save the current setting even after reboot run:
  ```
  sudo alsactl store
  ```
